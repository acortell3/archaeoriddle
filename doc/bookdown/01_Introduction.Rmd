# Introduction

## What is archaeoriddle?
Archaeoriddle started as a collaborative project at the Computational and Digital Archaeology Laboratory (CDAL) from the University of Cambridge. The idea is to develop and ABM to simulate an interaction process at the imaginary world of *Rabbithole* between the imaginary hunter-gatherers so-called *rabbitskinners* and the imaginary farmers so-called *poppychewers*. The project has also produced a large amount of media content for dissemination and engagement, most of which can be found [here](https://theia.arch.cam.ac.uk/archaeoriddle/)

There you will also find all of the information related to the project (or most of it anyway), but in brief, the idea behind it is to create a virtual world were *we*, as developers, know what happened, but where we only share partial data. With this, there are then some questions which interested participants have to answer with their own methods. In particular, we have created a map with 100 grids of which only 5 are shared commonly, and each participant has the right to request 5 more of their own preference. All these data has additionally gone through processes of creation and loss emulating the archaeological record. The idea is that each researcher tries to understand what happened so that the results of the different methodologies proposed can be compared.

The project has been a great success and presented at several conferences (dedicated presentations at CAA 2022, and 2023 and several other mentions), with a very interesting discussion at the dedicated workshop in the EAA in Belfast (2023) where interested participants presented their proposals. Everything is explained in more detail at the site referred above, and we are continuing to produce more documentation which will explain even more, but to be able to follow through this bookdown, this is the gist of it!

## What will you find in this bookdown?
This is the explanation of the model. Everything has been developed using R. You can reproduce *Rabbithole* (or something similar!) using the code here. You can download the package "archaeoriddle" from github, and you should be able to go through the process of creating *Rabbithole* here. This might be useful not only to create a virtual world from scratch attending to different archaeological constrains, but also to get some practice with R-based ABMs. Finally, all the data, the one that we produce (and it's at the site) or the one that you produce from this is free, and you can use with different for your own needs. We have structured the following chapters as follows:

-   Landscape, climate and environment : functions and methods to create 'realistics' artificial environments.

-   Population growth on multiple sites: functions and methods to design population that grows, dies, move, and fights

-   Record formation:  functions and methods to generate archaeological record given the population of each sites

-   Record loss: functions and methods to simulation loss of the record through time

-   Final choice and simulation: functions and methods that explore different population growths

-   Generate archaeological remains and squares

## What can you do with this?
Well, many things! First, we have discussed how the data already generated (which can be freely downloaded) can be used for research and education purposes. Also, you can use the code in this bookdown to generate your own Rabbithole and pose your own research questions with synthetic data. Additionally, this book is also a good document for the development of ABMs in R. 
All in all, our purpose is not only to bring awareness to the strengths and weaknesses of archaeological methodology, but also to provide material (e.g. methods, theory and code) for interested researchers so that they can reproduce their own virtual worlds and do their own experiments. Thus, we are proposing a tool that can be used for research, but which is also an excellent testing ground for educational and training purposes. Download things and toy around! Don't worry, you won't break anything!!
