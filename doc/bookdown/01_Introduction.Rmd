# Introduction

## What is archaeoriddle?
Archaeoriddle is a collaborative project at the Computational and Digital Archaeology Laboratory (CDAL) from the Department of Archaeology, University of Cambridge. The project started with the idea of developing an ABM to simulate an interaction process in the imaginary world of *Rabbithole* between two fictitious groups: the hunter-gatherers called *rabbitskinners* and the farmers called *poppychewers*. Through this world, the project can help explore the archaeological use of data and methods in a controlled environment to learn more about the act of research. The project has also produced a large amount of media content for dissemination and engagement, most of which can be found on the various social accounts linked to the project ([here](https://twitter.com/archaeoriddle/) or [here](https://fediscience.org/@archaeoriddle)). 


You can find  most of the information related to the project on these social media platforms, but in brief, the idea behind the project is to create a virtual world where *we*, as developers, know what happened, but *you* have access only to a small portion of the simulated archaeological evidence. Given this premise, we asked our participants some research questions, prompting them to approach the problem using their own methods. More specifically, we have created a map with 100 cells and shared the simulated archaeological contents of five of them with everyone. Each participant then had the opportunity to obtain information from five additional cells of their choice. All data had gone through processes of creation and loss, emulating the formation and preservation of the archaeological record. Our final aim was to compare how different participants engaged with the same problem, allowing us to compare different approaches and methodologies on a plain field. 

The project has been presented at several conferences (dedicated presentations at [CAA](https://uk.caa-international.org/) conferences 2022 and 2023, as well as mentioned in several others), culminating with a thought-provoking discussion at the dedicated workshop in the European Association of Archaeologists conference in Belfast (2023) where participants presented their proposals and answers. 


## What will you find in this bookdown?

This bookdown provides  details of the model used to generate the artificial archaeological record we used in the project. Everything has been developed using R. By downloading the package "archaeoriddle" from GitHub, you can reproduce *Rabbithole* or adapt it to create your own world using the code provided in this  document. This might help create a virtual world from scratch based on different archaeological assumptions but provide an excellent opportunity to learn how to build an R-based agent-based model (ABM). All the data, including those that we produced or the ones that you will produce using this platform, is free, and you are free to modify it to suit your differing needs. We have structured the chapters of this document as follows:

1. [Introduction](#introduction): this introduction
2. Chapter&nbsp;\@ref(env) [Landscape & resources:](#env) functions and methods to create a 'realistic' artificial environments.
3. Chapter&nbsp;\@ref(popgrowth) [Population structure & growth:](#popgrowth) functions & methods to initialise site location, population structure, and growth.
4. Chapter&nbsp;\@ref(conflict) [Migration & conflicts:](#conflict) functions & methods that handle population movement and interaction.
5. Chapter&nbsp;\@ref(main-simu) [Main simulation:](#main-simu) the main function that wraps together the previous elements to simulate the interaction processes.
6. Chapter&nbsp;\@ref(recgen) [Record formation:](#recgen) functions & methods that generate the archaeological record given the population of each site generated during the main simulation.
7. Chapter&nbsp;\@ref(recloss) [Record loss:](#recloss) functions & methods to simulate the loss of the archaeological record through time.
8. Chapter&nbsp;\@ref(final-output) [Generate Final archaeological record:](#final-output) functions & methods that wrap together the main simulation, the record formation and loss, and generate shareable files for people to explore.
9. Chapter&nbsp;\@ref(original-challenge) [Archaoriddle: the original challenge:](#orignal-challenge)  The full description of the parameters, simulation runs and data generated, as well as the five proposals gathered from the participants of the original challenge.

## What can you do with this?
Well, many things! We have mentioned that the data generated in the original challenge (which can be freely downloaded [here](https://github.com/acortell3/archaeoriddle/tree/main/doc/bookdown/data_original)) can be used for your own research purposes or as an educational tool. We encourage you to use the code in this bookdown to generate your own *Rabbithole* and pose your own research questions with synthetic data. 


All in all, our purpose is not only to bring awareness to the strengths and weaknesses of specific computational methods in archaeological research, but also to provide material (e.g. methods, theory, and code) for interested researchers so that they can reproduce their own virtual worlds and do their own experiments. Thus, we are proposing a tool that can be used for research, but which is also an excellent testing ground for educational and training purposes. Download things and toy around! Don't worry, you won't break anything!!
