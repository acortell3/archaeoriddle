CDAL collaborative ABM

There are two documents uploaded (both are latex files). 
The idea would be to discuss a little bit these issues (and any other you guys can think of) before starting with the code of the model.
Please feel free to edit, add and remove anything you want.

I was thinking to leave this for a while, so that everyone can bring in her/his ideas, and then do a poll among all of us to see the path to take for the final model
